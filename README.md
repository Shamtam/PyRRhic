# PyRRhic
A Python-based RomRaider derivative

## Getting Started with Development

1. Install Python 3.8
2. Clone repository (including submodules) to directory of your choice
3. In the repository top level directory, setup the virtual environment
    to the directory `./venv` and install all requirements:

```
.../PyRRhic/ $ python -m venv venv
.../PyRRhic/ $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. [_**Optional, but recommended**_] VSCode settings have been included
    in the repository. To use them, simply open the root directory of
    the repository in VSCode as a folder. Settings include the debug
    launch configurations, and some basic settings to facilitate style
    consistencies (e.g. vertical rulers at 72 and 79 chars, per PEP8,
    auto-trim whitespace, 4 spaces as tabs, etc.)
